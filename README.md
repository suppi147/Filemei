## Introduction

Filemei is an online file-storing system with fast uploading, it also provides a link for downloading with a file timeout expiration.

## Features
- We help you store small stuffs like images or word files or maybe a **1GB file**. Then they can be downloaded and shared with a simple **link**.
- For every **20 minutes the file will timeout** for security and resources save purposes.

## Technologies Used
- JSP 2.3, javascript, CSS
- Java Servlet 3.0

## Demo
- I'm so sorry to announce that Filemei is currently shut down due to the lack of financial support :<. Anyway, if you still feel interested about my project, please contact me by [facebook]((https://www.facebook.com/khoi.lee.2090/)
